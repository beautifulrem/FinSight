# Documentation

This directory holds the detailed project documentation. The root README is intentionally short; use these pages when you need contracts, configuration details, training steps, or downstream handoff notes.

## Contents

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Query Intelligence](query-intelligence.md) | Scope, architecture, API, NLU and retrieval output contracts, live providers, environment variables, troubleshooting. |
| [Training](training.md) | Public dataset sync, manifest-based training, runtime asset materialization, evaluation, and release checks. |
| [LLM Response](llm-response.md) | Downstream answer-generation JSON, DeepSeek defaults, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Anthropic, local API servers, and legacy transformers mode. |
| [Sentiment](sentiment.md) | Downstream document sentiment pipeline, preprocessing, FinBERT routing, output fields, and test commands. |
| [Retrieval Output Spec](retrieval_output_spec.md) | Compatibility entry point for `analysis_summary` and retrieval output references. |

Chinese documentation is in [docs/zh](zh/index.md).

## Documentation Style

The structure follows the common pattern used by mature open-source projects:

- The root README answers "what is this, how do I run it, where do I go next?"
- `docs/` contains stable reference pages split by topic.
- Commands are copyable from a fresh clone and avoid local-only wrappers.
- Public docs avoid generated output, private tokens, and machine-specific paths.
