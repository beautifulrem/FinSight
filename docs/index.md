# Documentation

Languages: English | [中文](zh/index.md)

These pages document FinSight, the ARIN7012 Group 4.2 evidence-first financial analysis chatbot project. The technical backend module is Query Intelligence.

The root README is intentionally short; use these pages when you need contracts, configuration details, training steps, or downstream handoff notes.

Chinese documentation is in [docs/zh](zh/index.md).

## Documentation Style

The structure follows the common pattern used by mature open-source projects:

- The root README answers "what is this, how do I run it, where do I go next?"
- `docs/` contains stable reference pages split by topic.
- Commands are copyable from a fresh clone and avoid local-only wrappers.
- Public docs avoid generated output, private tokens, and machine-specific paths.
