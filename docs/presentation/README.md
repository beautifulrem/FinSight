# Presentation Materials

This folder is the cleaned presentation entry point for the FinSight project.

The original `PPT_Overleaf` backup contained older browser screenshots, LaTeX build byproducts, unrelated image assets, and raw planning notes. The reusable content has been consolidated here as a clean slide outline and linked to the current documented frontend screenshots.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [slide-outline.md](slide-outline.md) | Presentation-ready structure, talking points, and demo flow. |
| [agent-design-notes.md](agent-design-notes.md) | Agent layer design review (Chinese): decisions and trade-offs, failure cases, ablation conclusions, limits, interview Q&A. |
| [../assets/frontend-chatbot-zh.png](../assets/frontend-chatbot-zh.png) | Current Chinese chatbot demo screenshot. |
| [../assets/frontend-chatbot-en.png](../assets/frontend-chatbot-en.png) | Current English chatbot demo screenshot. |
| [../frontend-chatbot.md](../frontend-chatbot.md) | Full frontend runbook and verified local test notes. |
| [../query-intelligence.md](../query-intelligence.md) | Backend architecture and API contract reference. |

## Cleanup Decisions

Kept:

- Current frontend screenshots generated from the latest `/chat` UI.
- A polished slide outline aligned with the implemented system.
- Links to stable documentation pages instead of duplicating large raw notes.

Not carried forward:

- `main.aux`, `main.log`, `main.nav`, `main.out`, `main.snm`, and `main.toc`: LaTeX compilation byproducts.
- Old `Financial Chatbot by Group x` screenshots: superseded by the current Group 4.2 UI screenshots.
- Unrelated visual assets such as the ice cream vendor image.
- Raw source notes with temporary brainstorming language.

If a final PPT/PDF is exported later, place only the final artifact or clean source under this folder.
